    "text": "This was a great first real day of hiking! The first trail head, mount Galbraith, is 14 minutes from my front door! Score! This is what we moved here for!\nFirst we hit up Einstein Brothers for a coffee and a couple bagels and shmear as a quick pick me up (and a well needed snack later - just you wait)\nLike any self-respecting trail head, a map greeted us at the onset. Jefferson County (where we live) has a series of “open spaces” which are essentially all the parks and hikes and green area. It’s really cool.\nAfter a couple of switch backs we caught a quick glimpse of the north end of Golden, CO - we had to drive through Golden to get to the trail head. I can only imagine Kora was thinking “Food, warmth, humans - lets go back that way…”\nAfter we rounded the first knob, across a saddle from us was the Coors brewery! I drove past on the way in - it was more impressive from the highway - and was looking forward to gazing back down on such a stanchion of American mass production (note: All the big “American” beer brands are no longer owned by American companies).\nAn underwhelming submission to Window’s stock background was behind us as we looked Northwest - it was much more interesting looking back across the foothills in person. This is how most of my landscape shots end up. You could see old fire damage on many of the stumps as you toil up this mountain.\nOn second though, I’ll spare you the photo. Carry on reading, and thank me the next time you see me.\nThe next photo spot was perfectly framed by an old red pine and a young juniper. Suffice it to say my current quest is to beat these photos on my next few weeks of hiking. The following shots are, as this goes to press, front runners for 2023 shots of the year.\nThis trail loops the top of this mountain, and on the SE side of the loop, we were presented with an awesome view, the clouds and sun combining to give an epic landscape that unfolded off into the distance. Landscape shots are not my specialty, as mentioned before, but this one has everything; depth, good lighting, and well… my blessing I guess.\n(also, I’m not sure how this panorama will show up so I’m including a rectangular shot as well, semi-dups)\nThen we hiked down, and the hike was done! A few hours and 4+ miles before 10 am - not bad!"

    "text": "Day two of hiking - first but not last time I’m the only one out in shorts and a t-shirt! This was a nice little loop starting near Red Rocks and getting up on a plateau with a great view of the surrounding area.\n\n\n\nRed Rock valley\n\n\nI think I camped in the valley in the background way back in 2019.\nThere was a group of very friendly folks that spoke mostly Spanish (reminding me of my shortcoming of only speaking one language) that Kora and I kept leapfrogging. They were sooooo excited to pet this little mutt and were blasting music from a backpack as they hiked. They were fun, I love being around people that are also loving life. Their joy was infectious :)\n\n\n\nThe reddest rocks\n\n\nRight at the end I caught this vertical panorama of the classic rock formations giving the area it’s name. The photos don’t do it justice but that’s par for the course. Taking good landscape photos is a skill I do not really possess. Try and try again I shall, though. Thanks for coming along for the ride!"

    "text": "Ah, a 30 minute drive and this was the first time I felt like I’ve gotten into the mid country (not quite back country but it felt different than the front country of the other hikes up until this point). Last first, after our hike I went into the Golden Gate Canyon State Park Ranger Station (GGCSPR) and it was awesome. Tons of info, very modern, some taxidermied animals, and post cards and stickers.\nI was tempted by a couple of the identification books; flowers, rocks, trees, more flowers, birds, fish, etc. but didn’t pull the trigger. They were close but not quite it.\n\n\n\nThat golden disc\n\n\nThe sun was blazing today. After a midweek dip into the negative temps (Fahrenheit) we were back up to the 40s and 50s today, but when that sun hit you, oooooooooeeeeeee, did it feel good.\nThis was another hike were I took the steep incline to a long, steady decline route (clockwise). The way up had my heart a pounding, reminding me of the good old Donut Shop and the custom workouts that, when you really got into them, had your head floating a few extra feet off the ground. If you’ve had the pleasure, you know what I’m talking about :)\n\n\n\nThe holiest of dogs\n\n\nI snapped this pic looking back down the valley, we drove in on that road, and wouldn’t you know it - when I get home I see that Kora had an extra set of eyes looking out for her on this hike. Which is good someone was watching out for her because by the end I don’t think she was having it besides when she got all excited to find a decaying mouse carcass (picture omitted, thank me later).\n\n\n\nNot-a-summit\n\n\nI think this was the high point of our hike, altitudinally speaking, and in hindsight, maybe this was where Kora started to get sick of my manic picture taking…\nThis is what we came here for. I believe this was close-but-under 10k feet, after a 1200 foot climb from the car over ~2 miles. It is just beautiful here. I couldn’t be happier.\n\n\n\nHome alone\n\n\nAfter the peak it was a cool series of meadows where homesteads used to be. This one was titled something like “Old, Lonely, Crippled, and Alone” - really selling it I know - and was the story of a man who had some cows and one day, when using a cart to bring some freshly cut logs down to market, a chain snapped the the logs crushed his skull. They did not leave much to the imagination nor view this guy’s existence through rose colored glasses, that’s for sure.\n\n\n\nSuper secure your belongings with Pete!\n\n\nWe get back to the car, which I definitely locked, only to realize I left both back windows down. I’m glad none of the thieves that tried the door handles to find them locked noticed the windows weren’t simply super duper clean but were, in fact, wide open.\n\n\n\nSustenance\n\n\nLuckily the bagel and cream cheese, which has become a staple after-hike snack, was still in the car. Don’t worry, I shared, contrary to what that look Kora’s giving me may imply.\nAlso, by the end of this hike, Kora had had enough and was protesting going the last few hundred yards. I’m not sure why, it was pretty muddy and rocky at the end and I’m not sure if her paws were sore or she was just tired. She got some extra treats (not just bagels and schmear) when we got home and she’s formally protesting any further activities today by napping soundly on my bed."

The hike is recorded on GPS and on the maps post, and so I am leaving this entry brief to say, yes, I hiked! But also this list starts at 0 as in zero pictures from this wonderful day.\nI was joined by Nick, an old pal from way back when, and wish I’d gotten a shot of us to share. Guess this one’s stuck in the old memory bank only."

    "text": "Betasso Preserve - this was a really cool drive up middle boulder creek, getting some elevation to start this hike. The trailhead may have been the highest point, actually. Very quickly the view panned out back down the valley, way way off in the distance there is Boulder!\n\n\n\nWay down yonder be Boulder!\n\n\nThis was a short-ish loop where I got in my head we were definitely going to see elk. I kept Kora on a leash because I can imagine nothing worse than her creating a stampede of elk (think Lion King wildebeest) and me dying of shame. No harassing the wildlife on my watch!\nThis was a cool trail, it sneaked around some knobs and zigged and zagged through trees, open hillsides, snow, and grass.\n\n\n\nSnakey trail!\n\n\nI will definitely enjoy coming back to explore some of the other trails, there was an option to extend this with an extra loop but I think we started at ~3pm and light was the limiting factor on this day.\nI’ll leave you with this shot from the driver’s seat of my car on the way down Boulder Canyon - it was a really cool drive, and it seems like in the winter here there is not quite as much going on in the hiking scene. Everyone must be skiing. I had this drive and hike pretty much all to myself. The all-encompassing “it” was neato.\n\n\n\nThe drive!"

    "text": "Back up to Boulder! This hike started off as about as vertical of a mile as I’ve hiked in quite some time. On the way up we learned, from some passing strangers that the up-hill goer has the right of way, and our pesky midwestern sensibilities that demand we step off the trail out of the way of anybody within .25 miles are actually running counter current to the vibe of this middle-lattitude and middle longitude West (not to be confused with the midwest, which I don’t think we’re actually in even if the moniker would make sense, but I digest).\n\n\n\nSomewhere past the horizon is Fort Collins\n\n\nOn the way up, plenty of our stops included sweeping vistas of the front range, looking north up along the steppes of the Rockies. Tales of a mythical far off land (Fort Collins) have been passed down from generation to generation but I have yet to visit it, and my cousin who lives there. It’s on the short list of things to do though, mark my words.\n\n\n\nPeak excitement\n\n\nThe peak of this hike was very cool, looking out over the vast plains of what is Eastern Colorado. Is it not just unbelievable how this very very natural rock formation at the peak looks uncannily like a human-made plaque? We were in awe of the sheer statistical improbability of this assurredly completely natural phenomenon.\nWhat was less natural and more human fabricated and installed seemed to be this chimney:\n\nAs we achieved the summit I was frantically searching my pistachio brain for a reference to Lord of the Rings, to name the mountain (Caradaras, in hindsight) and crack a joke about how the dwarves in the Mines of Moria must have let the cookfires go out. But alas, like many of my wittiest jokes, this one, too, went undelivered.\nIt was a mud pit the whole way down, and the camera didn’t come back out. Nick definitely will have to wash his shoes after this one :)"

    "text": "Quick Tuesday night adventure (the first of many I hope) - hiked up the East side of North Table out in golden Golden. I never realized it but a town name that is also an adjective is not all that common. They set themselves up.\n\nI am ensconced with taking photos into the sun. I can’t tell you why. My phone doesn’t do all that great a job, and you can sort of see the grain in the photo in the shadows of the above photo, but I just love it. Maybe it’s the contrast, a point of blinding white light gives an otherwise washed out photo a wee bit more depth.\nI’m lucky Kora is a willing subject, she knows “up” and “sit” along with the best of them :)\n\n“Sunglasses off and even though it hurts, open your eyes for the photo” … only one of us committed.\nOk, not much to talk about on this hike - we snuck it in after a work day after all, and it was windy and chilly. My hands were happy once the car started blowing hot air on the drive home!\n\nLast shot, a panorama looking down over Denver. One minute after this photo Kora caught a whiff o mule deer and chased the herd down the East face of the mesa - not my proudest moment. She got the leash for the rest of the hike upon her return."
