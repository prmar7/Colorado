Betasso Preserve - this was a really cool drive up middle boulder creek, getting some elevation to start this hike. The trailhead may have been the highest point, actually. Very quickly the view panned out back down the valley, way way off in the distance there is Boulder!

This was a short-ish loop where I got in my head we were definitely going to see elk. I kept Kora on a leash because I can imagine nothing worse than her creating a stampede of elk (think Lion King wildebeest) and me dying of shame. No harassing the wildlife on my watch!

This was a cool trail, it sneaked around some knobs and zigged and zagged through trees, open hillsides, snow, and grass.

I will definitely enjoy coming back to explore some of the other trails, there was an option to extend this with an extra loop but I think we started at \~3pm and light was the limiting factor on this day.

I'll leave you with this shot from the driver's seat of my car on the way down Boulder Canyon - it was a really cool drive, and it seems like in the winter here there is not quite as much going on in the hiking scene. Everyone must be skiing. I had this drive and hike pretty much all to myself. The all-encompassing "it" was neato.
