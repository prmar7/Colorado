Back up to Boulder! This hike started off as about as vertical of a mile as I've hiked in quite some time. On the way up we learned, from some passing strangers that the up-hill goer has the right of way, and our pesky midwestern sensibilities that demand we step off the trail out of the way of anybody within .25 miles are actually running counter current to the vibe of this middle-lattitude and middle longitude West (not to be confused with the midwest, which I don't think we're actually in even if the moniker would make sense, but I digest).

On the way up, plenty of our stops included sweeping vistas of the front range, looking north up along the steppes of the Rockies. Tales of a mythical far off land (Fort Collins) have been passed down from generation to generation but I have yet to visit it, and my cousin who lives there. It's on the short list of things to do though, mark my words.

The peak of this hike was very cool, looking out over the vast plains of what is Eastern Colorado. Is it not just unbelievable how this very very natural rock formation at the peak looks uncannily like a human-made plaque? We were in awe of the sheer statistical improbability of this assurredly completely natural phenomenon.

What was less natural and more human fabricated and installed seemed to be this chimney:

As we achieved the summit I was frantically searching my pistachio brain for a reference to Lord of the Rings, to name the mountain (Caradaras, in hindsight) and crack a joke about how the dwarves in the Mines of Moria must have let the cookfires go out. But alas, like many of my wittiest jokes, this one, too, went undelivered.

It was a mud pit the whole way down, and the camera didn't come back out. Nick definitely will have to wash his shoes after this one :)
