Technically my first day of hiking in Colorado was at Chautauqua (Boulder) on the Flat Irons, but I apparently did not take any pictures except a car selfie, see thumbnail for this hike. The hike is recorded on GPS and on the maps post, and so I am leaving this entry brief to say, yes, I hiked! But also this list starts at 0 as in zero pictures from this wonderful day.

I was joined by Nick, an old pal from way back when, and wish I'd gotten a shot of us to share. Guess this one's stuck in the old memory bank only.
