I never realized it but a town name that is also an adjective is not all that common. They set themselves up.\n\n![](noble_mutt.png)\n\nI am ensconced with taking photos *into* the sun. I can't tell you why. My phone doesn't do all that great a job, and you can sort of see the grain in the photo in the shadows of the above photo, but I just love it. Maybe it's the contrast, a point of blinding white light gives an otherwise washed out photo a wee bit more depth.\n\nI'm lucky Kora is a willing subject, she knows \"up\" and \"sit\" along with the best of them :)\n\n![](no_sun_jays.png)\n\n\"Sunglasses off and even though it hurts, open your eyes for the photo\" ... only one of us committed.\n\nOk, not much to talk about on this hike - we snuck it in after a work day after all, and it was windy and chilly. My hands were happy once the car started blowing hot air on the drive home!\n\n![](denvy.jpg)\\\nLast shot, a panorama looking down over Denver. One minute after this photo Kora caught a whiff o mule deer and chased the herd down the East face of the mesa - not my proudest moment. She got the leash for the rest of the hike upon her return.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"my_day.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"North Table","date":"2023-02-28","categories":["hiking"],"image":"squinty_dog.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
