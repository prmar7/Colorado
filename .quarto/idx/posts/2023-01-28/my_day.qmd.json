The trailhead may have been the highest point, actually. Very quickly the view panned out back down the valley, way way off in the distance there is Boulder!\n\n![Way down yonder be Boulder!](boulder.PNG){alt=\"Coffee and a map\"}\n\nThis was a short-ish loop where I got in my head we were definitely going to see elk. I kept Kora on a leash because I can imagine nothing worse than her creating a stampede of elk (think Lion King wildebeest) and me dying of shame. No harassing the wildlife on my watch!\n\nThis was a cool trail, it sneaked around some knobs and zigged and zagged through trees, open hillsides, snow, and grass.\n\n![Snakey trail!](trail.png){alt=\"Just a map\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nI will definitely enjoy coming back to explore some of the other trails, there was an option to extend this with an extra loop but I think we started at \\~3pm and light was the limiting factor on this day.\n\nI'll leave you with this shot from the driver's seat of my car on the way down Boulder Canyon - it was a really cool drive, and it seems like in the winter here there is not quite as much going on in the hiking scene. Everyone must be skiing. I had this drive and hike pretty much all to myself. The all-encompassing \"it\" was neato.\n\n![The drive!](safety_second.png)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"my_day.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Betasso Perserve","date":"2023-01-28","categories":["hiking"],"image":"betasso.PNG"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
