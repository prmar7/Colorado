Day two of hiking - first but not last time I'm the only one out in shorts and a t-shirt! This was a nice little loop starting near Red Rocks and getting up on a plateau with a great view of the surrounding area.

I think I camped in the valley in the background way back in 2019.

There was a group of very friendly folks that spoke mostly Spanish (reminding me of my shortcoming of only speaking one language) that Kora and I kept leapfrogging. They were sooooo excited to pet this little mutt and were blasting music from a backpack as they hiked. They were fun, I love being around people that are also loving life. Their joy was infectious :)

Right at the end I caught this vertical panorama of the classic rock formations giving the area it's name. The photos don't do it justice but that's part for the course. Taking good landscape photos is a skill I do not really poses. Try and try again I shall, though. Thanks for coming along for the ride!
