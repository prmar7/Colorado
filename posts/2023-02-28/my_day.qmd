Quick Tuesday night adventure (the first of many I hope) - hiked up the East side of North Table out in golden Golden. I never realized it but a town name that is also an adjective is not all that common. They set themselves up.

I am ensconced with taking photos *into* the sun. I can't tell you why. My phone doesn't do all that great a job, and you can sort of see the grain in the photo in the shadows of the above photo, but I just love it. Maybe it's the contrast, a point of blinding white light gives an otherwise washed out photo a wee bit more depth.

I'm lucky Kora is a willing subject, she knows "up" and "sit" along with the best of them :)

"Sunglasses off and even though it hurts, open your eyes for the photo" ... only one of us committed.

Ok, not much to talk about on this hike - we snuck it in after a work day after all, and it was windy and chilly. My hands were happy once the car started blowing hot air on the drive home!

Last shot, a panorama looking down over Denver. One minute after this photo Kora caught a whiff o mule deer and chased the herd down the East face of the mesa - not my proudest moment. She got the leash for the rest of the hike upon her return.
